## DMSP gene analyses

Repo for looking at the DMSP genes in monocultures and TARA:
1. blast analyses of MMETSP transcriptomes and NCBI refseq genomes, reblast analyses of eukaryotes to check for any prokaryote contamination
2. align and build phylogenetic trees
3. use hmm searches in TARA to make global maps of DMSP synthesis genes (maps were made in R by modifying Meren lab script found here: https://github.com/merenlab/world-map-r)
